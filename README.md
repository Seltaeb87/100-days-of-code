Here you can check out my progres with the 100daysofcode.
Currently working on my own portfolio website. You can check it out here: [Portfolio](https://github.com/Seltaeb87/portfolio)

## Day 1: June 06
Started with some simple HTML and CSS setup for my portfolio page. Forgot to put it on GitHub, so I did it today(7th of june)

## Day 2: June 07
Pushed my first steps of my portfolio website on GitHub.
Added some mock-up pages in html. Created a basic contact form on the contact page. Check it out:

`P.S: I just realised that making the same header, menu and footer(or al what comes back at every page) should be made once and included on every page of the website.
So build one header and include that on every single page. Instead of building the header over and over again.`
