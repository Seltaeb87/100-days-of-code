Here you can check out my progres with the 100daysofcode.
Currently working on my own portfolio website. You can check it out here: [Portfolio](https://github.com/Seltaeb87/portfolio)

## Day 1: June 06
Started with some simple HTML and CSS setup for my portfolio page. Forgot to put it on GitHub, so I did it today(7th of june)

## Day 2: June 07
Pushed my first steps of my portfolio website on GitHub.
Added some mock-up pages in html. Created a basic contact form on the contact page. Check it out:

`P.S: I just realised that making the same header, menu and footer(or al what comes back at every page) should be made once and included on every page of the website.
So build one header and include that on every single page. Instead of building the header over and over again.`

## Day 3: June 08
So, I changed all my files from .html to .php. This way I can include several files.
I'm building a header and can include that on every page. 
When I change something in header.php, it changes on each page.
See my [portfolio](https://github.com/Seltaeb87/portfolio).

## Day 4: June 09
Today I spent about an hour to style my menu a bit. Went pretty well if I say so myself!
Only thing I can't figure out is the jQuery part of it. When I go to a page, the menu of that page needs
to be highlighted. It works on "Home", but when I go to another page, the higlighted menu item jumps back to "Home".

`P.S: Does this make any sense? Haha`
